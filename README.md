### Hi, I'm Eliane! 👋 (pronounciation: El-ee-awn-knee) 

I graduated from Stanford University in 2019, where I studied philosophy and took significant coursework in journalism and psychology. Since graduating, I have completed a yearlong fellowship with the [American Voices Project](https://americanvoicesproject.org/), the largest qualitative study ever conducted in the US, and assisted three 2020 Democratic political campaigns. Now I am working on several projects and  seeking full-time roles in public opinion research. Cheers! 🥂
