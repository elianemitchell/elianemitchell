I am a Research Analyst at YouGov, working on global tracking and ad hoc studies for the country's largest social media companies. In 2019 I graduated from Stanford University, where I studied philosophy and took significant coursework in journalism and psychology. Since graduating, I have completed a yearlong fellowship with the [American Voices Project](https://americanvoicesproject.org/), the largest qualitative study ever conducted in the US, and assisted three 2020 Democratic campaigns. I am now working on projects related to politics, psychology, and data. Please feel free to send feedback to this relatively new useR!
