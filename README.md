Hey there, I'm Eliane! 👋🏽 (pronounced: "El-ee-awn-knee") 
</h2>

I graduated from Stanford University in 2019, where I studied philosophy and took significant coursework in journalism and psychology. Since graduating, I have completed a yearlong fellowship with the [American Voices Project](https://americanvoicesproject.org/), the largest qualitative study ever conducted in the US, and assisted three 2020 Democratic political campaigns. I am now working on several projects related to politics and data, in addition to seeking full-time roles or internships in public opinion research. Please feel free to send feedback to this relatively new useR!
